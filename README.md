## Overview

In this project, I used pair plots and customized visualizations to analyze how different variables relate to each other in a multivariable dataset. Pair plots are powerful tools that display pairwise relationships and distributions in one comprehensive matrix.

This analysis is valuable for:

* Identifying correlations between variables
* Detecting patterns and outliers
* Guiding feature selection for modeling

---

## Features

* Clean pair plot visualizations using **Seaborn**
* Custom enhancements to improve readability:

  * Colored class labels
  * Adjusted markers and palette
  * Upper/lower triangle control
* Supports both numerical and categorical data
* Modular and easy to extend to your own datasets

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multivariable-visual-analysis.git
cd multivariable-visual-analysis
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis_pairplots.ipynb
```

2. Replace the example dataset with your own if needed.
3. Customize the pair plot parameters (palette, markers, etc.) for your needs.

---

## Examples

Here’s a preview of what you can do:

* **Basic Pair Plot:** Explore raw relationships across variables
* **Customized Pair Plot:** Add hue, style, and color palettes for more detail
* **Focused Analysis:** Highlight specific variables or groupings
* **Joint Plots:** Zoom in on relationships between two specific variables with added regression or density plots
* **Correlation Heatmap:** Visualize the strength of relationships between variables using a color-coded matrix

*Example output plots are available in the `images/` folder.*

---

## Customization

The main customization options available in the code include:

* `hue=` to color by a categorical variable
* `kind=` to choose between `scatter`, `reg`, or `kde`
* `corner=True` to hide upper triangle
* `diag_kind=` to change the diagonal plot type (hist, kde)

You can also use Matplotlib and Seaborn functions to style titles, axis labels, or plot grids.
